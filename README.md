# yip-websocket-server-demo
A demo to show how a websocket is implemented on a Node.js server using the socket.io library.

It uses the Express.js and Node.js built-in `node:http` module to create the main server.
### Testing
- Fork this repository
- Run ```run npm install``` in your terminal.
- To start the server, run ```npm start```.
- You can then connect to the socket server from any socket.io client implementation using either of this url: `ws://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`.

Thank you and happy coding!
